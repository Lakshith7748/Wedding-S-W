            <h1>‟Welcome to the Vibrance of Punjab Weddings”</h1>
            <p>Welcome to a world where love meets tradition, and every moment is a celebration of life. Punjab weddings are a vibrant symphony of emotions, culture, and grandeur, and through my lens, I capture the heart of it all. From the spirited beats of the dhol to the sacred vows of the Anand Karaj, every detail is preserved in timeless frames.

                As a photographer, I don’t just document events—I tell stories. Every laugh, every tear, and every dance move becomes a cherished memory. My passion lies in turning fleeting moments into lasting treasures, ensuring that nothing is missed. With me, your wedding becomes an everlasting masterpiece.</p>

            <h1>‟Anand Karaj – The Sacred Union”</h1>
            <p>Capturing the Anand Karaj is a sacred experience, and my focus is on preserving its serenity and emotional depth. The serene Gurdwara setting, illuminated by divine light, becomes a timeless backdrop in every frame. I captured the bride and groom’s graceful Laavan rounds, reflecting their love and commitment. Candid moments, like parents’ proud smiles and the couple’s quiet reverence, add authenticity to the story. Every vibrant detail—from the bride’s intricate attire to the groom’s regal safa—is highlighted. Wide shots of the congregation in prayer showcase the unity and spirituality of the moment. The soulful kirtan and blessings were photographed to evoke the ceremony’s divine essence. Through my lens, the Anand Karaj becomes a poetic celebration of love, tradition, and faith.</p>
